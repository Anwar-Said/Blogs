		  <h3>Intro</h3>
                I am a  4th year Ph.D. research scholar in <a href="http://ai.itu.edu.pk/">AI Lab</a>, Department of Computer Science at Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan. 
		I received M.Phil. (2016) degree in Computer Science from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, and M.Sc. degree with distinction from universtiy of Swat, Pakistan. 
		My research belongs to the area of graph representation, which deals with the representation of graphs into a low-dimensional embedding space. 
		In particular, I analyze and design graph descriptors that only rely on the graph's structure using constructs from graph theory. 
		I also work in social network analysis and graph theory to design solutions for different real-world problems in different domains. 
		More recently, I have expanded my research to deep learning on graphs with an emphasis on feature set representation and models' architecture. 
		I am expected to be graduated this September.
